This repo is the codebase from which Timelockr-Client and Timelockr-Server-Demo were split.  I have retained it as a public repo to show a continuous commit history going all the way back to the beginning of development.  Doing so establishes that I am the author of my own demo, and gives employers a chance to explore my learning process, as writing the app was the main tool I used to learn web development.
