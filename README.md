This repo is the codebase from which [timelockr-client](https://github.com/jehillert/timelockr-client) and [timelockr-server-demo](https://github.com/jehillert/timelockr-server-demo) were split.  I have retained it as a public repo to show a continuous commit history going all the way back to the beginning of development.  Doing so establishes that I am the author of my own demo, and gives employers a chance to explore my learning process, as writing the app was the main tool I used to learn web development.

An interactive demo of Timelockr may be found [here](https://timelockr.hillert.dev/).
